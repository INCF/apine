		"TaskDescription": "A motion discrimination task with an embedded stop signal task was performed 8 times across different sessions. On each trial, a moving dot stimulus (Britten et al., 1992) was presented, with coherence of either upward or downward motion varying across trials (levels: 0%, 10%, 30%, and 70% coherence). On 25% of trials, a visual stop signal (change of the fixation cross from white to red) was presented, at a delay controlled by a 1 up/1down staircase in order to ensure 50% stopping accuracy (Logan, 1994). The subjectâ€™s task was to perform the motion discrimination as quickly as possible, but withhold responses when the stop signal occurred (acquisition time = 7:11).",
